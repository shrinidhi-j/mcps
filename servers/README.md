# MCP Servers

This directory contains implementations of various MCP (Metaverse Content Provider) servers.

## Server Implementations

Each subdirectory represents a different MCP server implementation with its own configuration, documentation, and code.

## Adding a New Server

To add a new MCP server implementation:

1. Create a new subdirectory with a descriptive name
2. Include a README.md with:
   - Server description and purpose
   - Architecture overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Configuration options
   - API documentation
3. Include all necessary code and configuration files
4. Add deployment instructions if applicable

## Server Requirements

For consistency across implementations, each MCP server should:

- Document its API endpoints
- Include configuration examples
- Provide clear setup instructions
- Define supported metaverse platforms
- List dependencies and requirements

## Best Practices

- Use containerization when possible (Docker)
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Include logging and monitoring capabilities
- Support scalability features
- Document performance considerations
